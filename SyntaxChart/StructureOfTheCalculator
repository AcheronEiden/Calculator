The Python calculator code follows this process:

1. The user input is checked to determine if it is an assignment, a command, or empty.
* If it is a command, the corresponding action is performed.
* If neither an assignment nor a command, the user is prompted for a new input.

* If it is an assignment, the code handles it accordingly, checking for variable overwriting.
* In the expression process, the code performs addition or subtraction based on the next token.
* In the term process, the code performs multiplication or division based on the next token.
* In the factor process, the code checks various conditions such as assignments within parentheses,
no argument variables withing parantheses, already defined single-argument assignments within parentheses
or a name/number/negative sign.Different code paths are taken depending on the condition.
